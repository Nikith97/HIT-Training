//JAVA Supports Multilevel Inheritance, not multiple inheritance as the class can be one kind of a parent class,cannot be parents class.
/*Why Inheritance
 * 1. Object Reusability
 * 2. Create a part-whole hierarchy
 * 3. We support multiple Inheritance in Interfaces - As interfaces are roles
 * 4. Normal Classes are Classifications - Part/Whole hierarchy
 * 5. Composition
 * 6. Eliminate if-else-if
 * 7. Code Resuability
 * 8. Polymorphic Queries
